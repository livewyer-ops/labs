## Blog

### KEDA series

The KEDA blog series introduces the CNCF project Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA), a tool built on top of the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) without replacing it, and explains how you can get started using KEDA.

The link to the first blog post in the series is https://livewyer.io/blog/introducing-kubernetes-event-driven-autoscaling-keda

The [blog/keda](./blog/keda/) directory in this repository contains the instructions for re-producing the demos described in the KEDA blog series.
